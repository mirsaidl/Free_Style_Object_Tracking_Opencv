### Project details
This project is for Digital  Image Processing class 

### Dense Optical Flow

Dense optical flow is a computer vision technique used to estimate the motion of objects between two consecutive frames of a video. Unlike sparse optical flow, which tracks specific points, dense optical flow computes the motion vectors for every pixel in the image. This method is essential for tasks like object tracking, motion analysis, and scene understanding, providing a detailed view of the motion within a video frame.

**Key Features:**
- Captures fine-grained motion details across the entire frame.
- Utilizes algorithms like Farneback, TV-L1, or deep learning models for accurate flow estimation.
- Commonly used in applications involving video stabilization, action recognition, and dynamic scene analysis.
